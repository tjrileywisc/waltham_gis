    "to comply with the MBTA Communities law.\n",

    "This [page](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/compliance-model-components) has an Excel workbook that helps communities to pinpoint which restrictions\n",

    "\n",
    "After the community is selected, a few housing required parameters will auto-populate (pre-calculated developable land amounts, required housing units etc.)\n",
    "and the person filling out the workbook needs to define one or more districts that will be re-zoned to fulfill the requirement. The other sheets of the Excel\n",
    "workbook allow entering restrictions like setbacks or floor area ratios and will flag requirements that need to be relaxed in order for the calculation to work."
